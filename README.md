# tv_counting
tv_counting python script is topology violation (TV) analysis tool for post-analysis of polymer structure which is simulated from molecular dynamics program. The tv_count script can be flexibly employed on interface with the general trajectory or dump files of general used MD programs such as Gromacs, Amber, LAMMPS programme packages, or even typical coordinate (xyz format) data file.

# remove_nLine
The remove_nLIne bash script is used to generate/adjust the format of xyz coordinate to suitably work with tv_count.py script afterward. Please be careful in using both of scripts, you can also learn what the proper format of coordinate by seeing test files in this repository.

## Application
You can find the application of topology violation analysis in the research article of THE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS136, 134903 (2012) by Timothy W Sirk et al. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.3698476].

## Motivation of Project
This repository is created with the motivation of project of Thailand Computationl Chemistry Challenge by UBE.
