# Motivation
This repository is created with the motivation of project of Thailand Computationl Chemistry Challenge by UBE.

# tv_counting
tv_counting is Topology Violation analysis tool for post-analysis of polymer structure which is simulated from molecular dynamics program. the tv_count.py script can be flexibly employed on interface with the general trajectory or dump files of MD program, says, Gromacs, Amber, LAMMPS programs, or even typical coordinate (xyz format) file.

# remove_nLine
It is just a very simple bash script for generate and adjust the format for tv_count.py script.

# Application
You can find the application of Topology Violation analysis in this research THE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS136, 134903 (2012) by Timothy W Sirk et al [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.3698476].
